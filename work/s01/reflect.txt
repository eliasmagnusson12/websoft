1) I did know about Git, GitHub. I've heard about Markdown, but i've did not knew about GitHub Pages
2) Yes we have created some websites before in previous courses. But we merely scraped the surface, so
this is new territory for me.
3) In our project course (Software Engineering 2) we created a website for our smarthouse. But this is the only time I've done a whole website
We have created some minor websites when we learnd about restfulAPI, but in that course the focus was on creating restfulAPIs and not websites.
4) Today I learned about GitHub pages which was really cool. I also learned some basics html which is always nice.
