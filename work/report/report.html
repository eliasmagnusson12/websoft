<h2>S01</h2>
    <p>1) I did know about Git, GitHub. I've heard about Markdown, but i've did not knew about GitHub Pages</p>
    <br><p>2) Yes we have created some websites before in previous courses. But we merely scraped the surface, so this is new territory for me.</p>
    <br><p>3) In our project course (Software Engineering 2) we created a website for our smarthouse. But this is the only time I've done a whole website</p>
    <br><p>We have created some minor websites when we learnd about restfulAPI, but in that course the focus was on creating restfulAPIs and not websites.</p>
    <br><p>4) Today I learned about GitHub pages which was really cool. I also learned some basics html which is always nice.  </p>
