  <br>    A: HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements. </p>
  <br><p> Q: Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
  <br>    A: The browser initiates a TCP connection to the webserver or server pool (using port 80 by default) through its IP address as published in DNS. As part of this process, the browser also makes DNS lookup requests to convert the URL to an IP address.
  <br>       After the server completes the acknowledgment of its side of the TCP connection, the browser sends HTTP requests to the server to retrieve the content. </p>
