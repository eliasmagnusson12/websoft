<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
    <p>     Q: Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
      <br>  A: I did know about Git, GitHub. I've heard about Markdown, but i've did not knew about GitHub Pages</p>
    <br><p> Q: Have you ever created websites before?
    <br>    A: Yes we have created some websites before in previous courses. But we merely scraped the surface, so this is new territory for me.</p>
    <br><p> Q: Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
    <br>    A: In our project course (Software Engineering 2) we created a website for our smarthouse. But this is the only time I've done a whole website,
    <br>       I have created some minor websites when we learnd about restfulAPI, but in that course the focus was on creating restfulAPIs and not websites.   </p>
    <br><p> Q: What is your TIL for this course section?
    <br>    A: Today I learned about GitHub pages which was really cool. I also learned some basics html which is always nice.  </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S02</h2>
  <p>     Q: Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
    <br>  A: Yes from when we did our smartHouse project we worked with vue.js, where we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript </p>
  <br><p> Q: Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.?
  <br>    A: HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements. </p>
  <br><p> Q: Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
  <br>    A: The browser initiates a TCP connection to the webserver or server pool (using port 80 by default) through its IP address as published in DNS. As part of this process, the browser also makes DNS lookup requests to convert the URL to an IP address.
  <br>       After the server completes the acknowledgment of its side of the TCP connection, the browser sends HTTP requests to the server to retrieve the content. </p>
  <br><p> Q: What is your TIL for this course section?
  <br>    A: Today I learned about how to effecivly add images to your website and also how to copy files from a forked GitHub repo.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p>     Q: Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?
  <br>  A: Yes, I have done a project with vue.js before which is an open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework </p>
<br><p> Q: Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?
<br>    A: The language I'm most comfortable with is Java, and even thouhghb JavaScript maybe not relate to it so much if you compare it to other language it still has alot of the same syntax. But as I mentioned before vue.js is a language which really could be compared to JavaScript.  </p>
<br><p> Q: Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
<br>    A: For this exercise I aimed for the grade 5 and the code turned out really well actually, exactly how I wanted it. I worked with this exersice for a whole day and put some effort into it to be able to fetch the correct municipality</p>
<br><p> Q: What is your TIL for this course section?
<br>    A: In this section I've learned a lot more about CSS and JavaScript. When it comes to CSS I feel like I can more quickly create the design I want. Also learned about xampp</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>     Q: Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.
  <br>  A: As previously mentioned, I have done a project with vue.js before which is an open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework and in that project we worked with node/npm</p>
<br><p> Q: How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?
<br>    A: I enjoy it very much, I think it is quite easy to understand what is going on and how to implement the correct solutions, even though it's going great I still learn alot for every new assignment, which is great.  </p>
<br><p> Q: Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?
<br>    A: I just followed the instructions and worked my way from the bottom, and it worked out pretty well.  </p>
<br><p> Q: What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?
<br>    A: For this exercise I aimed for the grade 3, because i knew my time was limited this week, will try to get to a higher grade for later. But for now a 3. For a the level 3 i did not think it was very difficult.  </p>
<br><p> Q: What is your TIL for this course section?
<br>    A: I learned more about using Node and express. I improved my JavaScript skills even further. I also learned some more about the routing of the different pages.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S05</h2>
<p>     Q: How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?
  <br>  A: I actually really enjoyed it as a back-end-language. It was quite easy to grasp right from the start and it is a language that I want to learn more about</p>
<br><p> Q: Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?
<br>    A: From my own experience there isn't really another programming language that I have used that looks or feels like PHP, as stated Java is the one that I'm most experienced with, and of course they are both server-side-languages, but other than that there is no other ressemblance that I can think of. If anything the syntax looks more like JavaScript in terms of that you dont have to declare the type when creating variables </p>
<br><p> Q: Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
<br>    A: For this exercise I looked a lot a your videos and worked my way from the bottom to structure the code in a correct way. Starting with creating the database. I aimed for the grade 3, because i knew my time was limited this week, will try to get to a higher grade for later.  </p>
<br><p> Q: What is your TIL for this course section?
<br>    A: The most important thing i learned was using PHP and database</p>
</section>

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>     Q: What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?
  <br>  A: my own opinion on popularity of programming languages is that the most populare ones are the ones that has been around for some time like Java or all the C languages like C+, C++ and somewhat C#. For the future I think the easier the language is to grasp the more popular it will be. As we can see with python which is a easy script-language to understand(but hard to master) and is very fast growing. </p>
<br><p> Q: What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?
<br>    A: When I focus on which programming language to learn more about I must enjoy working with it to be willing to really dig deep into it. And also I always look at job advertisment to see what they require and which language that is the most requested.  </p>
<br><p> Q: Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.
<br>    A: I decided to compare Java with C++, because of they are both to old giants in the industry. And what i could see which was a bit of a surprise was that they both looked very stable the last 12 month. C++ even hade some upward curve in the graph.  </p>
<br><p> Q: If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?
<br>    A: of course it depends on the project. But if that is a factor that does not matter in this case then I would recommend some kind of JavaScirpt framework, because there is a lot of manpower out there with a lot of knowledge in the language.  </p>
<br><p> Q: What is your TIL for this course section?
<br>    A: I learned that even if there comes up some new buzzwords or some new populare languages, the old ones are still going steady and are still widely used with no signs of stepping down.  </p>

<h2>S07</h2>
<p>     Q: Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.
  <br>  A: ASP stands for Active Server Pages, ASP is a development framework for building web pages. ASP.NET is ahigh-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, Internet-connected applications. C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. </p>
<br><p> Q: Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.
<br>    A: To start of I think this section with the .Net technologies was the hardest section to grasp if I was to compare it with the other ones. There was a lot of things going on in the background a lot of things that was auto generated and a lot of templates. So for a newbe with the .NET technologies it was sometimes hard to keep up.</p>
<br><p> Q: Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
<br>    A: I aimed for the grade 3. For this exercise i started with the console wich i thought was a lot easier than the webapplication. I think that is because we are used to do console applications from our time working with Java. The web application was a lot harder and took some time to really get it to work. But in the end I'm happy with the result. </p>
<br><p> Q: What is your TIL for this course section?
<br>    A: The TIL for this course section would be everything that has to do with the .NET technologies because of how new this territory was for me.</p>

<h2>S08</h2>

    <p> <b>Group members:</b> Elias Magnusson </p>
    <p><b>Websites chosen:</b> Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn</p>
        <p> I chose these websites because they are very similiar in their content. So it will be
            interesting to compare them. </p>
            <p> <b>Findings and elaboration</b> </p>
            <p> The best of the three websites was definitely Twitter, it loaded the fastest, and performed best
                on almost every aspect. LinkedIn was not very far behind, as it also was a quick and good website.
                Facebook on the other hand, was not very close to the other two websites. It was a slow 
                website compared to them. 
                I used pagespeed to see the biggest problems of the websites and how to solve them.
                And there I was able to see why Facebook was performeing so badly, the bad performance is directly linked to all the advertisment on the website.
                The website handle the loading of the advertisment images in a bad way, which seems very surprising for a website like Facebook.
                Facebook also had was also told to 'Avoid an excessive DOM size' which could increase memory usage, and cause longer style calculations,
                and the website had alot of excessive DOM size. So thet should Avoid an excessive DOM size. </p>

                <p><b>Down below you can see the documented data from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn</b></p>
                <p><img id="myImg" src="../../../../../../work/report/img/dev_table.png" alt="Image" height="70" width="900"></p>
                  <p> <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b></p>
                  <p> I learned how to compare and analyse different websites. </p>

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>One concern i often have that is related to the OWASP top ten is the 'Sensitive Data Exposure'. A lot of applications/services wants a lot of data when you are signing up for/to them,
but my concern is if all of this applications that takes my information really have the proper security to protect all my sensetive data.  
</p>
<p>Another concern i often have that is related to the OWASP top ten is when I develop some software and also always have to thinks about the security. I might feel like a competent
   developer, but my strength isn't security. So number 6 'Security Misconfiguration' is something that i really can relate to. 
</p>
<p>'Broken Authentication' is another one from OWASP top ten that I as a developer can relate to, it is extreamly important to configure Application functions related to authentication in a correct way.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>My guidelines to follow to create secure web applications would be take your time to focus on the security within the application. Another tip would be to always use Https insted of http because it's more secure.
      Another way to easy enhance the security would be to use multi-factoring authentications.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>My TIL for this assignment is that I have learned about the top ten security issues in web programming.
