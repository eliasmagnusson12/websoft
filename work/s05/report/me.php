<h1>My report page in the course DA377B VT20</h1>

<p><img src="img/me.png" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is Elias Magnusson, born and raised in Landskrona, Sk√•ne. I have tried out many different sports in my youth but the sport that i really liked was handball. I have played handball all my life, until last year when I had to stop because of a knee injury</p>

<p>I've had a couple of different professions in my adult life, I never really knew what I wanted to become "when I grew up" until I found this education that I now study at the University of Kristianstad, I also work as a software tester at Qlik in Lund</p>

<p>If I should mention a hobby, besides sports and softwares, then I really like to be out in the nature with my dog and my partner Sofie</p>
